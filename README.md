### Part 1: Self-Assessment Reflection

1. **Skills Analysis**:
    
    - List your current skills and areas of expertise.
     
     I am a quick learner and I found to be pretty good at thinking out of the box. I have good interpersonal and intrapersonal skills. My expertise range from html to css and look at the finer details in the code.

    - Identify skills you need to develop or improve.
      
    I need to develop my code more in the sense that i should be learning other cool tricks that can elebvate my code even more. I do also need to improve my time management.

2. **Interests and Values**:
    
    - Describe your key interests related to your career.

    I'm interested in the  possibility of exploring both front and backend of development and being able to think creatively whilst also being able to think of solutions to problems. And it would be really cool to explore the systems of the computers. And who doesn,t want to make games?

    - What values are important to you in a work environment?

    Respect and teamwork I feel are very important in the workplace.

### Part 2: Career Exploration Insights

1. **Industries and Roles Explored**:
    
    - List the industries or roles you have researched.

    Full-stack was one of the only other fields that piqued my interest because I think it would be cool to get to work with a concept i am already familiar with.

    - Note any particular areas that piqued your interest.

    Making websites would be familiar and allow me to take my craft to new heights.

2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:
    
    - Reflect on how these industries/roles align with your skills, interests, and values.

    It aligns with my skills because the majority of the course thus far has been about websites and that industry would make me feel at ease because it is something i have already worked with.

    - Identify any gaps or areas for further exploration.

    I need to face the code more and become more familiar with it. In other words I should treat it like another language that I am basically speaking to my computer. Right now I I'm still only seeing it as a concept. 

### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):
    
    - List your specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goals.

    I want to be in a position of confidence in my abilities as a developer as well as have confidence in my code. I want to be a big contributor to others' projects globally and make a respectable name for myself. 

    - Explain the rationale behind each goal.

    I say this because reputation and abilities are what anyone sees before they see YOU. That is why it's important to build a repetoir. If my employer has confidence in me then that will only push me more to excel.

2. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):
    
    - Outline your long-term career aspirations.

    Long term I see myself either working in a successful tech company or running my own company and projects and maybe do community out reaches for those who show an interest in tech but have no way to start.

    - Describe how these align with your interests and skills.

    They align with my interest of becoming confident and reputable. And it also links to my passion. Sharing your passion with others who share the same heart, only makes everything better in terms of growth for all those involved.

### Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:
    
    - Detail specific actions or steps needed to achieve each short-term goal.
    - Include any resources or support required.
   
    I will have to take more time each week to practice my skill. Try small games and projects on the Web to put my skills to the test. Start socialising with other local developers. Once I am confident in my abilities I will start contributing to others' projects. I think it would also help to join a dev community and keep up with the latest tech and code advancements. 

2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:
    
    - Describe the preparations or groundwork necessary for your long-term aspirations.
    - Consider additional skills, experiences, or qualifications needed.

    Long term i feel I should specialise in more coding languages to propel my career, reputation and skills.  I would have to dress more presentable and put myself out there instead of being timid. I should build on my confidence and work on my interpersonal skills. And work for as many tech companies as possible. Each experience always teaches you something new. 

### Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

1. **Anticipated Challenges**:
    
    - Identify potential obstacles or challenges in reaching your goals.
    - Consider strategies to overcome these challenges.

    I expect there to be obstacles such as self-doubt and lack of motivation, but the best way to combat that would to be take everything one step at a time. Take a step away and relax with family. Practice each concept until it becomes second nature. 

2. **Opportunities for Growth**:
    
    - Highlight any opportunities you can leverage for career growth.
    - Include networking, mentorship, or educational opportunities.

    There's potential in growth through showcasing my skills in my current school projects as well as participating frequently in contact sessions and joining networking events to get my name known.
